# Assignment 2 (10 points): Data Transformation & EDA

Submit your answers in the Jupyter Notebook Assignment2.ipynb.

## Q1 (2 points):
Starting with the diamonds dataset, report the median price, median carat, and the count of observations per each tuple of (cut, color, clarity).

## Q2 (3 points):
The diamonds dataset consists of 10 variables. Perform a variation analysis of every single variable. I would like you to use all of the following commands depending on the nature of the variable (continuous vs categorical).

```R
geom_bar
count
cut_width
geom_freqpoly
geom_histogram
```

## Q3 (5 points):
The diamonds dataset consists of 10 variables. Perform a covariation analysis of every single pair of variables. In total their are 45 (10 choose 2) pairs of variables. I would like you to use all of the following commands depending on the nature of the pair of variables (continuous-categorical, categorical-categorical, or continuous-continuous).

```R
geom_count
count
geom_tile
geom_freqpoly
geom_point
geom_bin2d
geom_hex
geom_boxplot
cut_width
cut_number
```
